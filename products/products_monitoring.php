                            PACCS AMS ( alarm management server) is a versatile monitoring system that can act on input from alarm modules, personal alarms with location information, messages and data from handsets. Different actions can be taken for different types of input. For example, send a message with request for acknowledges, activate an output in the system, and send information to a third party. in fact with the customisation capability of the system applications are viable for sites from just a few users to organisations with hundreds of users.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            When a PACCS NETcall receives an alarm, a chain of responses is initiated. First, information in the alarm is processed; for example, the location of a fixed alarm button is translated to a descriptive text. Then the information can be put together to a message sent to a pocket unit in the system. If a response has not been received within a pre-set time, further actions can be taken. Escalation of actions and monitoring and alert acknowledgement and reset are possible remote options.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Monitoring can be for single site or multiple site situations. Monitoring can be done by us, by security monitoring companies personnel or the client organisation or any combination of the above.

                    The TWIG Point alarm gateway service is a professional purpose–designed platform for facilitating and configuring Duress alarm systems. TWIG Point is one of the world’s most advanced duress alerting and device fleet management platforms. (This is purpose-designed for duress use and not simply a car asset tracker software adapted for duress alarm systems.)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    In assisting lone-workers the platform available includes TWIG Point and an alarm gateway service. It can be applied for duress only so that the monitoring centre is alerted or also included mapping. Multiple servers are available. In general, the process operates this way, as soon as any untoward event (duress event, person-down, ripcord, amber alert etc.) is detected by a duress device i.e. duress, person-down, rip cord, amber alert, battery low, it will automatically send an event to our gateway.

                    Alarm processing: The alarm and the GPS location or last known GPS location of the device is sent to the gateway server, the location and the alarm can be seen and logged.

WWSI do not force you to use any particular monitoring centre- but the client can suggest and if they have their own arrangement already, we are open to discussing having the TWIG devices on that.</li>
