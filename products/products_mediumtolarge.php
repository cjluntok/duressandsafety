                            This can be an expanded version of the previous solution for smaller sites and you need to know the general location of the person, such as in a building. You may also need the capability for users to talk with each other, such as in a hospital or large manufacturing site. Generally, in a duress situation you will know where they are because their transmitter is pre-assigned to a specific area.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Another need can be when people can be anywhere in a facility, and you need to know exactly where they are in a duress situation. Here, the transmitter signals to a network of sensors which then receive the message and calculate where the person is, sending a signal back to a computer panel. This application could be appropriate for an aged care facility or a large busy warehouse.

                                You may have many users across a large site. They need to be able to notify others onsite of a duress event, or even talk to each other. And you need to know where they are so help can be given quickly. You may need voice contact. You may need to alert others off site. We offer several systems, the key features and benefits of which are described here.
