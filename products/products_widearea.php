                            Users carry or wear a small unit that has a duress button and optional automatic person-down features. The unit communicates directly via the 3G mobile phone network. When activated, a text message, data message, or voice message is sent to several destinations alerting staff to a situation. The unit may also open a one or two-way voice channel so that the monitoring staff can listen in to the incident. Location coordinates can also be sent with the message and these can be entered into mapping programs such as Google Maps, or other web-based mapping programs we can supply for your team.

                                TWIG is a world-class purpose-designed line of duress and person-down products manufactured in Salo, Finland. TWIG products are small person-down and duress transmitters that operate across the mobile phone network. They message directly to mobile phones or landlines with both sms and two-way voice call alerts.
                                </p>

                                <p>A <strong>duress</strong> alert can be activated simply by pressing a button on the twig device.</p>

                                <p>With the <strong>"ManDown"</strong> feature, TWIG will send an alarm when it tilts beyond more than a defined angle or registers no-motion for a specified period of time. The time frame and tilt angle like many other features can also be programmed. The unit then beeps and vibrates to warn a message is about to be sent, allowing time for cancellation. The pre-warning time can also be specified.</p>
                                
                                <p>In some models, the person down function can also be easily switched on and off by the user with the press of a button.</p>

                                <p>In an emergency event, the following actions can occur:</p>

                                <p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>ten emergency numbers can be programmed into the unit to receive either a SMS message, a dialed call or both</li>
                                        <li>a duress events begin with the unit sending a SMS text message to all numbers on the SMS list</li>
                                        <li>the unit starts dialing numbers on the voice-call list in sequence until one answers</li>
                                        <li>a two-way voice channel is then opened between the sender and the receiver</li>
                                        <li>four additional buttons can direct-dial to frequently called numbers with a single press of the button, which enables a non-emergency assistance call – in some models, there is only one direct-dial button</li>
                                        <li>the unit requires a SIM card provided by the purchaser</li>
                                        <li>as an option, in duress situation the unit also secures a satellite GPS position and displays this on a map</li>
                                        <li>if you have the GPS function, a free location map can be brought to your Smartphone by simply clicking the link that is in the SMS alert you receive when the SOS button or automatic person down is activated</li>
                                        <li>you can also request a location from TWIG with a coded SMS request</li>
                                        <li>TWIG can also be managed through TWIG Point (TWIG Webfinder) if additional messaging, locating and tracking features are required, or TWIG can be integrated into your own alarm management and location system.</li>

                                                <p>On certain models, by re-programming the four direct dial buttons, TWIG transforms into a unique timed-alert system. Before entering a potentially dangerous situation, you set a timer. If you do not cancel the timer within the time limit set, then TWIG enters a short pre-alert sequence giving you the time to either cancel or extend. If you take no action, TWIG then automatically starts the emergency alert sequence.</p>
