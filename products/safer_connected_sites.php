                        <h4 class="text-muted pb-10">The Safer Connected Site technology is used in education campus, hotels, hi-rise apartments, hospitals, health care facilities, industrial sites and construction sites.</h4>
    
                        <p>For more than 20 years we have been providing technology to sites around Australia and more recently around other countries providing them the edge in safety and communications. Whether it's for increasing safety and efficiency, real time location, duress, person-down signaling or just linking all your disparate communications systems together into one easier to control and faster-acting communications platform. We have implemented more than 5,000 sites with our advanced integrated communications.</p>
                    
                        <p>A client’s existing equipment can be upgraded/improved with the PACCS platform, which is a world-class Smart-Safety platform design for the Safer Connected Campus system. Integrates communications and monitoring to provide critical communications, emergency communications, evacuation, lockdown, duress and safety systems, Lone-worker systems, person-down systems, nurse-call systems, RTLS and location systems. Integrating speech, data, voice and video.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="text-muted pb-10">Works with equipment including:</h4>
    
                        <p>Duress and panic buttons, location tracking on-site, in–building, alerts, alarms, paging systems, two-way radio systems with alerts, messaging, M2M systems, emergency services, emergency evacuations by floor, lockdown control, integration across many platforms BMS, security and front-of-house software systems.</p>
